# booklist

This repo is where I learn and play with new technologies.  The idea is to implement a fully functioning book collection websiteâ€”basically a more realistic 
version of ToDo. 

The first iteration, in progress, is with ReactJS, Redux and Bootstrap.  Future iterations may potentially look at ... whatever is thriving 
whenever the React version is done.
