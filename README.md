# booklist

This repo is where I learn and play with new technologies.  The idea is to implement a fully functioning book collection websiteâ€”basically a more realistic 
version of ToDo. 

All iterations will share the same data access, controllers, and AWS access code.  Controllers are scaffolded via my easy-express-controllers 
project (https://www.npmjs.com/package/easy-express-controllers); data access is through Mongo; and all book info is looked up with my own AWS credentials, 
subject to an unfortunate one-request-per-second limit imposed by Amazon.

The first iteration, in progress, is with ReactJS, Redux and Bootstrap.  

Future iterations may potentially look at ... whatever is thriving whenever the React version is done.
